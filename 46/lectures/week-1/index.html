<h1>Week 1</h1>

<p>
  This week we'll talk about course logistics and expectations. We'll also go over HTML and CSS basics. With your new found skills you'll publish a very simple course profile page, which will be your ongoing homepage for the course.

<p>
  This is <em>your course</em>. So you decide how much you want to get out of it and how much you're willing to put in. This is what success looks like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Missing no more than two classes</li>
  <li>Doing all your homework</li>
  <li>Taking written notes during lectures</li>
  <li>Helping other students with topics you understand</li>
  <li>Presenting a final project on the last day</li>
  <li>Complete exit tickets after each lesson</li>
  <li>Complete mid &amp; end-of-course surveys</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Notice that success is not defined by the quality of your work. You're not here to learn everything about how to build web applications. Some people learn material faster than others. Some people have more prior knowledge than others. So define your own expectations of success.
</p>

<h3>Missing a class</h3>

<p>
  If you have to miss a class, no problem, just let the instructional team know ahead of time. Try and schedule a time with someone to review the material you will have missed.
</p>

<h2 id="slack">Slack</h2>

<div class="sidebar">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://slack.com/downloads">Download Slack</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../../resources/slack.html">Slack Pro-tips</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
  All course communication will happen on Slack. So it's critical to make sure you're set up and receiving notifications.
</p>

<p>
  Slack is designed to help us all communicate and stay on the same page but it a perfect tool and it has some drawbacks. Jason Fried discusses some of the <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat-744659addf7d#.eb9dl1gvj">pros/cons of group chat</a> and I think it's worth a read.
</p>

<p>
  Here are some ground rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong style="color: green">Yes to:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Self-coordinating study groups</li>
      <li>Posting notes and whiteboard pictures</li>
      <li>Reaching out to the instructional team for help</li>
      <li>Emojis 😃</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong style="color: red">No to:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Chatting during lectures</li>
      <li>Talking about other people</li>
      <li>Distracting GIFs and videos</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="atom">Atom</h2>

<div class="sidebar">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://atom.io">Download Atom</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Why do we use a text editor? As opposed to, say, Google Docs or Word?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Atom is the text editor of choice for this class. You're welcome to use something else but your own if you get stuck.
</p>
