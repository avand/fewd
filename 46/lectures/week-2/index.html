      <h1>Week 2</h1>

      <p>
        This week we'll talk about course logistics and expectations. We'll also go over HTML and CSS basics. With your new found skills you'll publish a very simple course profile page, which will be your ongoing homepage for the course.

      <h2 id="floats">Floats</h2>

      <img src="images/balloon.png" class="supporting-image">

      <p>
        When you want an image and text to appear side-by-side, you want to `float` the image (usually) to the `left` or `right`.
      </p>

      <p>
        The balloon to the right is <code>float: right</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once an element is floated, it is no longer part of the "document flow," which can often have unintended consequences.
      </p>

      <h3>Clearfix</h3>

      <p>
        A "clearfix" is a hack used to manage layouts with floats, see <a href="http://learnlayout.com/clearfix.html">this example</a>. The modern way to do this is by adding the CSS property <code>overflow: auto;</code> to the parent.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="floats.html">Example</a>
      </p>

      <h2 id="classes-ids">Classes &amp; IDs</h2>

      <p>
        Classes and IDs allow us to identify and target styles on elements based on more than just their tag name. Let's say you have a particular button style you like. You'd like to be able to style <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> in the same way. One way to do this is to attach your styles to both elements:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/cbbee16526a0f8e9ae31aa6e2152c588.js"></script>

      <p>
        Creating a class allows apply styles to any element as we choose. Define a class with a <code>.</code> followed by your own name. And in your HTML, give elements that class with the class attribute.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/88c98588a081697a9d344be3de342a96.js"></script>

      <h3>Sharing styles and writing less code</h3>

      <p>
        An element can have as many classes modifying it as you'd like. This let's us share common styles and get more specific as we need to.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/9ad27f2e9d8d2bdf2b89d001580ff540.js"></script>

      <p class="you-do">
        Now, do some practice with creating classes by making some buttons. Create a class <code>.button</code> and apply it to <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> (of type "submit"). Continue adding CSS declarations until all the buttons look the same. Then create a <code>.button-small</code> and <code>.button-danger</code> class that allows you to change the look of certain buttons simply by adding those classes. Here's an <a href="buttons.html">example</a> of the final result.
      </p>

      <h3>IDs</h3>

      <p>
        IDs work just like classes but are less flexible because <strong>an element can only have one ID</strong>. You also use a <code>#</code> instead of a <code>.</code> to select an element by ID.
      </p>

      <h2 id="block-inline">Display: block &amp; inline</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Block</strong> elements are "100% wide" and do not let any other pieces of content share space on the same horizontal row.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Inline</strong> elements are as wide as their content and allow other elements to share space to the left and right.
      </p>

      <h2 id="div-span">div &amp; span</h2>

      <p>
        When you can add whatever descripitors you want to an element via classes or IDs, the name of the element becomes less important. For example, you could have a paragraph that serves as the "introduction" to an article. If you had a <code>&lt;introduction&gt;</code> tag, you might use it instead. In cases like this, consider using a completely generic element like <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.html">CSS properties &amp; inheritance</a></li>
        <li><code>inherit</code></li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="file-references">File references</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><code>/</code> at the beginning of a path means "go to the root". For example, <code>/images/logo.png</code> will look for a file in an images folder that is at the root. But root can mean different things. If you're serving a file up in Chrome with <code>file://</code> then root means your hard drive. If you're running a web server, for example with <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> then root means your website project folder.</li>
        <li><code>..</code> means "go up a folder"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It is recommended to references files in a "relative" way. So you have to ask yourself, "from the file I'm in, how do I get to the file I want to reference."
