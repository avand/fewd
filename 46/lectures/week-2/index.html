<h1>Week 2</h1>

<p>
  This week we'll talk about course logistics and expectations. We'll also go over HTML and CSS basics. With your new found skills you'll publish a very simple course profile page, which will be your ongoing homepage for the course.

<h2 id="floats">Floats</h2>

<img src="images/balloon.png" class="supporting-image">

<p>
  When you want an image and text to appear side-by-side, you want to `float` the image (usually) to the `left` or `right`.
</p>

<p>
  The balloon to the right is <code>float: right</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Once an element is floated, it is no longer part of the "document flow," which can often have unintended consequences.
</p>

<h3>Clearfix</h3>

<p>
  A "clearfix" is a hack used to manage layouts with floats, see <a href="http://learnlayout.com/clearfix.html">this example</a>. The modern way to do this is by adding the CSS property <code>overflow: auto;</code> to the parent.
</p>

<h2 id="positioning">Positioning </h2>

<p>
  When you use anything other that <code>static</code> (the default value for position),
  you'll be able to use the properties <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>,
  <code>bottom</code> and <code>left</code> to adjust your elements position, but
  how it is positioned depends on what value you set position to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>position: static;</code>
    <p>
      Positions based on the content; cannot be adjusted and it's the default
      value for position for all elements (you probably don't need to know that,
      but can use it to sound cool at parties).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>position: fixed;</code>
    <p>
      Positions with respect to the browser window (useful for sticky headers and stuff).
      Use with caution because it will probably cover text!
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>position: relative;</code>
    <p>
      Positions relative to where it normally is.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>position: absolute;</code>
    <p>
      "Absolute children have relative parents!" An absolute child element will be positioned
      relative to it's parent (the one that has <code>position: relative</code>).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Examples: <a href="position-absolute.html">absolute</a> &amp; <a href="position-fixed-header.html">fixed</a>.
</p>

<p>
  What happens if you make the header on ACME Corp fixed?
</p>

<h2 id="classes-ids">Classes &amp; IDs</h2>

<p>
  Classes and IDs allow us to identify and target styles on elements based on more than just their tag name. Let's say you have a particular button style you like. You'd like to be able to style <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> in the same way. One way to do this is to attach your styles to both elements:
</p>

<pre>
<code>a,
button {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-radius: 5px;
  /* etc... */
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  What's bad about this?
</p>

<p>
  Creating a class allows apply styles to any element as we choose. Define a class with a <code>.</code>:
</p>

<pre>
<code>.my-button {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-radius: 5px;
  /* etc... */
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  And in your HTML, give elements that class with the class attribute.
</p>

<pre>
<code>&lt;a href="http://example.com" class="my-button"&gt;Click me&lt;a&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Sharing styles and writing less code</h3>

<p>
  An element can have as many classes modifying it as you'd like. This let's us share common styles and get more specific as we need to.
</p>

<pre>
<code>.my-button {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-size: 16px;
  padding: .25em;
}
.my-smaller-button {
  font-size: 12px;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  Practice with <a href="buttons.html">Buttons</a>.
</p>

<h3>IDs</h3>

<p>
  IDs work just like classes but are less flexible because <strong>an element can only have one ID</strong>. You also use a <code>#</code> instead of a <code>.</code> to select an element by ID.
</p>

<h2 id="block-inline">Display: block &amp; inline</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Block</strong> elements are "100% wide" and do not let any other pieces of content share space on the same horizontal row.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Inline</strong> elements are as wide as their content and allow other elements to share space to the left and right.
</p>

<h2 id="div-span">div &amp; span</h2>

<p>
  When you can add whatever descripitors you want to an element via classes or IDs, the name of the element becomes less important. For example, you could have a paragraph that serves as the "introduction" to an article. If you had a <code>&lt;introduction&gt;</code> tag, you might use it instead. In cases like this, consider using a completely generic element like <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.html">CSS properties &amp; inheritance</a></li>
  <li><code>inherit</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="file-references">File references</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>/</code> at the beginning of a path means "go to the root". For example, <code>/images/logo.png</code> will look for a file in an images folder that is at the root. But root can mean different things. If you're serving a file up in Chrome with <code>file://</code> then root means your hard drive. If you're running a web server, for example with <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> then root means your website project folder.</li>
  <li><code>..</code> means "go up a folder"</li>
</ul>

<p>
  It is recommended to references files in a "relative" way. So you have to ask yourself, "from the file I'm in, how do I get to the file I want to reference."
