      <h2 id="objects">Objects</h2>

      <p>
        If you remember back to when we first started learning JS, we talked about objects. Everything is an object. An object, to reiterate, allows us to describe things in code. It could be something simple like a Number, something domain-specific like a Movie, or an abstract thing like an Element.
      </p>

      <p>
        An object is a collection of properties (nouns) and methods (verbs). A method, remember, is just a fancy word for an object's functions. A Car object, for example, could have properties like <code>color</code>, <code>make</code>, and <code>model</code>. But it could also have methods like <code>start()</code>, <code>stop()</code>, <code>lock()</code>, and <code>unlock()</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We access the properties and methods of any object with a <code>.</code>. So, continuing with the car analogy, we would type <code>car.color</code> to access its color and <code>car.start()</code> to call the start method of the car.
      </p>

      <p>
        So far, you've been utilizing pre-defined objects. Document, String, Element, Event, and Array are built into your browser. You don't have to define their properties and methodsâ€”you just follow the documentation. They're pre-baked, built-in objects that are ready for you to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also define your own objects. There's an easy way and an advanced way. We're going to learn the easy way, with generic objects. The advanced way involves declaring a class, which will allow you to <em class="vocab">construct</em> instances of an object, for example <code>new User()</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's create a generic object, with a few properties and methods. Remember, we're not defining a new <em>type</em> of object. We're simply creating a container of nouns and verbs.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/3d7391c3055477a5ac0deeabb334bd40.js"></script>

      <p>
        This is the 4th type of <em class="vocab">literal</em> we've seen, where JS is able to create an object without refering to the object type. For example, when we write <code>"hello"</code>, we're telling JS that we want a String, whose value is "hello" but we never need to say "String". Similarly if you just type <code>3.14</code> you'll get a Float even though you never had to type "Float". Here, we're instantiating a new Object just by using <code>{}</code>. If this is confusing, don't sweat it, it's just the theory behind the example.
      </p>

      <p>
        All you need to know is that in that example, we're creating a plain vanilla object with a couple properties (<code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code>) and one method (<code>fullName()</code>). Notice that property names and the corresponding values are separated with a <code>:</code> and that property name/value pairs are separated with a <code>,</code>. The way the function is defined is also a little different. The name of the function is now on the left.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last thing to note is the use of <code>this</code>. <code>this</code> is a special keyword in JS and is a magically variable, whose value changes based on the context in which you reference it. Inside the <code>getFullName()</code> function, <code>this</code> refers to the user object. You could replace <code>this</code> with <code>user</code> and it would be the same. But using <code>this</code> allows us to reduce the repetition.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How is this useful?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        In the last set of the quiz, we had three arrays. One for <code>assignmentNames</code>, one for <code>assignmentDescriptions</code>, and a third one for <code>assignmentDueDates</code>. We're storing data about an "assignment" between three arrays. We hope that if you reference the 2nd assignment of each array that you're talking about the same assignment. But that could easily cease to be true. If the arrays are reordered or get screwed up somehow then <code>assignmentsNames[1]</code> may not map to the description in <code>assignmentsDescriptions[1]</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Objects to the rescue! Rather than have the data about one thing be scattered across three variables, let's keep it together. Let's create a few "assignment" objects and then put those objects in an array.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/08f006f1b2144fcecf1e53dc8161a76c.js"></script>

      <p>
        Now, the data about each assignment is together. It's much less likely for there to be a mix up and if you loop through <code>assignments</code> now, you'll have everything about the assignment right there.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/51e913fcfc09ab0487b1a4b83753124e.js"></script>

      <h2 id="json">JSON</h2>

      <p>
        You just learned about objects, which allow you to organize shared properties and methods. Basically, it's a storage mechanism. If you know a bunch of details about a person, you can drop them inside <code>{}</code>, correlate the keys and values with a <code>:</code>, and separate each set of key/value pairs with a <code>,</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As it turns out, this is incredibly useful. It allows us basically describe <em>anything</em> and also send it back and forth.
      </p>

      <p>
        GitHub, for example, exposes a special URL that returns all the details about a particular user.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/c6e7fba0230a902f82a19bef40899609.js"></script>

      <p>
        There's a lot of data there but basically it's everything GitHub knows about "avand," a user in their system.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you were to assign that object to a variable like <code>user</code>, you could access the user's bio by writing <code>user.bio</code>. If you wanted to know when that user was created, you would write <code>user.created_at</code>. Yes, this violates our camelcasing convention. That's OK. It's still a valid variable name. If it really bothers you, you should take it up with GitHub because that was a choice they made when they exposed this API.
      </p>

      <p>
        We're missing one thing important thing though. The response you get when you visit <code>https://api.github.com/users/avand</code> is not actually an object! It's just plain text. It's kind of like this:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/326fc2fce700654988c72d4231df45d4.js"></script>

      <p>
        Your brain looks at that string and says, "hey, that looks like an object" but technically, it's just a string. So it has a <code>length</code> just like other strings. But it doesn't have a <code>login</code> or an <code>id</code>. Bummer.
      </p>

      <p>
        This string is called <em class="vocab">JSON</em>: JavaScript Object Notation. It's a string representation of an object. It's <em>awesome</em> because it allows us to send JS objects back and forth.
      </p>

      <h3>Parsing JSON</h3>

      <p>
        So, if you have your hands on a JSON string, you're probably wondering, "how do I turn that into an object I can use?" We simply do this:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/99c610bd7b01ebe76b37c447c0d467c3.js"></script>

      <p>
        There's a special function <code>JSON.parse()</code> that we can use to convert a string into an object.
      </p>

      <p>
        Easy.
      </p>

      <h3>Writing JSON</h3>

      <p>
        You might also want to go the other way. Let's say you have some data organized in an object that you want to send to someone. You can convert that object into a JSON string like this:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/99c610bd7b01ebe76b37c447c0d467c3.js"></script>

      <p>
        You'll do this way less frequently, but it's worth knowing that it's available to you.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, having to call down <code>JSON.parse()</code> hopefully doesn't happen too frequently. Ideally you can use 3rd party libraries that will automatically parse the data you're downloading.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ajax">AJAX</h2>

      <p>
        OK, it's time to bring it all together. How can we use JS to go to GitHub, download that JSON, and use it in our application?
      </p>

      <p>
        We need to figure out how to perform an HTTP request with JS. This is often called <em class="vocab">AJAX</em>: Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. This acronym is actually a bit dated. These days we really are sending JSON back and form (not XML, another way to store data). I guess AJAJ doesn't have quite the same ring to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Performing an HTTP request relies on an object called an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>. It requires a few steps so we're not going to use it directly but here's what using it might look like:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/b564b89211709c6a26bee137d56b9aff.js"></script>

      <p>
        Yuck! OK, it's not actually <em>that</em> bad. To make it a little easier, let's create a function that does the heavy lifting for us.
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/063448ca7d475983e42bd3d331b83d63.js"></script>

      <p>
        We are now <em>writing</em> functions that take other functions as arguments. Just like <code>element.addEventListener()</code> that takes a string and a function, so does our new <code>get()</code> function. Instead of hard-coding our call to <code>console.log()</code> upon a successful response, we pass it in as <code>callback</code> to <code>get()</code>. And instead of hard-coding the URL, we just pass it in as a string.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, we can make (almost) any HTTP request we want, get the results, and do something with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Remember that our <code>get()</code> function, when it gets a successful response from the server, passes that response to our callback function. It is passed along as a <em>string</em>. So, if you're dealing with JSON response you still have to pass that string to <code>JSON.parse()</code> before you can use the data.
      </p>

      <div class="you-do">
        <p>
          Build a simple program that displays your name from GitHub, bio, and picture. Use <a href="https://gist.github.com/avand/0fc54327c3af2e78046f9ae1652608ba" target="_blank">this code</a> as the starting point.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Confirm that you see results in your console. The starting point gives you a head-start by immediately performing a <code>get()</code> and logging the response to the console.</li>
          <li>Use <code>JSON.parse()</code> to log one property of the response object to the console.</li>
          <li>Wire up the event listeners.</li>
          <li>Concatenate the value of the input to the URL to make a dynamic request to GitHub's API.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <img src="images/github.gif" class="img-responsive">
        </p>

        <p>
          It may also be helpful to take write the pseudo-code for this program first. This should really help you figure out where to get started. Try it for yourself then <a href="https://gist.github.com/avand/1cc7721b0dd07f61ae36460533314545" target="_blank">compare</a>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="jquery">jQuery</h2>

      <p>
        Helpful functions like <code>get()</code> that we just wrote are useful on every project. And it can become a pain to constantly re-write them from project to project.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, you'll find that <code>get()</code> is missing a feature or could do something better/faster/stronger. It would be nice if you could improve that function once and have every project you've built reap the benefits.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's why we create <em class="vocab">libraries</em>. A library allows us to put a bunch of common code that we use over and over again in one place. Libraries can be something you build for yourself or public that anyone can use. Libraries can also become open-source projects that benefit the community of developersâ€”assuming your library actually is beneficial.
      </p>

      <p>
        An incredibly popular JavaScript library is <em class="vocab">jQuery</em>. jQuery provides a lot of helpful functions for DOM manipulation, AJAX, and more. It also provides backward compatibility for a lot of features that make things work more consistently between browsers. For example, <code>document.querySelector()</code> isn't available in older browsers, so jQuery solves for that.
      </p>

      <h3>Vanilla to jQuery Mapping</h3>

      <p>
        Writing JS without any libraries is sometimes called "vanilla JS." There's kind of a gag website devoted to the idea too: <a href="http://vanilla-js.com" target="_blank">Vanilla JS</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's how vanilla operations map to their jQuery equivalent:
      </p>

      <table class="table">
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Vanilla JS</th>
          <th>jQuery</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Get element</th>
          <td><code>document.querySelector("span")</code></td>
          <td><code>$("span")</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Create element</th>
          <td><code>document.createElement("a")</code></td>
          <td><code>$("&lt;a&gt;")</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Add a class</th>
          <td><code>el.classList.add("class-name")</code></td>
          <td><code>$el.addClass("class-name")</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Remove a class</th>
          <td><code>el.classList.remove("class-name")</code></td>
          <td><code>$el.removeClass("class-name")</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Toggle a class</th>
          <td><code>el.classList.toggle("class-name")</code></td>
          <td><code>$el.toggleClass("class-name")</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Set an inline style</th>
          <td><code>el.style.backgroundColor = "blue"</code></td>
          <td><code>$el.css("background-color", "blue")</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Add child</th>
          <td><code>ul.appendChild(li)</code></td>
          <td><code>$ul.append($li)</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Get textContent</th>
          <td><code>a.textContent</code></td>
          <td><code>$a.text()</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Set textContent</th>
          <td><code>a.textContent = "new text content";</code></td>
          <td><code>$a.text("new text content");</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Get value</th>
          <td><code>input.value;</code></td>
          <td><code>$input.val();</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Set value</th>
          <td><code>input.value = "new value";</code></td>
          <td><code>$input.val("new value");</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Get attribute</th>
          <td><code>a.getAttribute("href");</code></td>
          <td><code>$a.attr("href");</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Set attribute</th>
          <td><code>a.setAttribute("href", "http://wikipedia.org/");</code></td>
          <td><code>$a.attr("href", "http://wikipedia.org/");</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Add event listener</th>
          <td><code>a.addEventListener("click", doSomething);</code></td>
          <td><code>$a.on("click", doSomething);</code></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Adding jQuery to Your Page</h3>

      <p>
        The easiest way to add jQuery to your page is by adding the following script
        tag to your HTML (put this tag before your own scripts, usually in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>):
      </p>

      <pre><code>&lt;script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js">&lt;/script></code></pre>

      <p>
        Google will host the jQuery JavaScript file for you and they actually encourage you to use their <em class="vocab">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</em> to serve up this file because your browser will cache it and use it between websites too.
      </p>

      <h3>Working with Collections</h3>

      <p>
        The most important difference with using jQuery for DOM manipulation is that
        jQuery always works with a "set" of elements. Before, you would do <code>document.querySelector("li.todo")</code>
        and that would just return ONE element. But when you do the equivalent with
        jQuery (<code>$("li.todo")</code>), you get a set of elements that match that
        selector. Furthermore, the DOM manipulation operations (like setting text content
        or changing an attribute or adding a class, etc.) are available on the set.
        In other words, jQuery makes it easy to manipulate more than one element at a
        time, which is usually helpful. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/3044b81aae160d95fcad48c3926d83ae.js"></script>

      <p>
        The <code>$</code> in front of the variable names is just a convention. It says "the object stored in this variable is a jQuery object, not a normal element."
      </p>

      <h3>AJAX in jQuery</h3>

      <p>
        jQuery also provides a way to do AJAX:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/d977bb055eb8dc2c0d61ce30bc15d84f.js"></script>

      <p>
        The signature of jQuery's <code>get()</code> function is the same as the one we just wrote so it's a drop in replacement.
      </p>

      <h3>Chaining</h3>

      <p>
        One of the most powerful features of jQuery is that almost every function you call returns something you can use to make another call. Think of it like this <code>$("ul")</code> returns a collection of elements. But <code>addClass()</code> also returns a collection of elements. So does <code>text()</code>, etc. So you can chain these methods together:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/dd5377d3b5a1052a5f0e3e3bafa721ca.js"></script>

      <p>
        And many of the jQuery functions are overloaded so you can call them in more convenient ways. For example, if you want to change the style of an element without a class, which happens when you need to specify a calculated value you don't have to repeatedly call <code>css()</code>. You can just call it once and pass in all the options:
      </p>

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/avand/dba9d4957ff9638fbacf934af9b177a7.js"></script>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
