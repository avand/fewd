      <h1>ACME Corp</h1>

      <p>
        The designers of ACME Anvil Corporation have just come up with a fresh new look for the company website. It's up to you to implement their designs. Their designers know a little bit about the web, so they've prepared for you a few resources to help you get started:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A screenshot of the finished design (see below, click for full resolution)
        </li>
        <li>
          A <a href="assets/acme-corp/images.zip">ZIP file</a> including the logo image and the textured background image
        </li>
        <li>
          A list of colors to use throughout the design:
          <ul>
            <li>Header background color: #c4c4c4</li>
            <li>Button background color: #2A4CB2</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The font-family: "Lucida Grande"
        </li>
        <li>
          Layout commentary: The header should run completely from the left edge of the browser window to the right edge. The content, including the footer, should be centered horizontally and consume approximately 80% of the width of the browser (not to exceed a width of 800px).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Here are some tips:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          It is entirely possible to implement this design without classes or IDs. You're welcome to use classes or IDs but it's probably unnecessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember that to center a block container (e.g. <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>) set <code>margin-left</code> and <code>margin-right</code> to <code>auto</code> and set a <code>width</code>. You can set the width to a percentage too. Try also playing with <code>max-width</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the "Digital Color Meter" under Utilities on your Mac to figure match the colors. When you have your mouse over the color you want, use <kbd><kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd></kbd> to copy the color to your clipboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          The buttons and links don't have to work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take advantage the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> elements to organize your content. Use the right tags and avoid using classes or IDs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element for the "Sign up" button. That will let you style it like a button, differently than the other links in the header.
        </li>
      </ul>
