        In this exercise, you'll be focusing solely on behaviorâ€”not the look and feel. And to that end you've been provided a <a href="assets/blog/blog.zip" download>ZIP file</a> to get you started. You'll see a blog.js file in the ZIP. That's where you'll begin writting your code. As you can see, there's already some code there to help you out.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two challenges here. Make the link increment the like counter and make the comment form add a comment to the page. You don't have to worry about the event handling portion of it although it would be great if you understand what's happening there.
